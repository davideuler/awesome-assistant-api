# Awesome Assistant API
Try assistant API apps on Google Colab for free.

Here I created some demos based on GPT-4V, Dall-e 3, and Assistant API.
So you can try these APIs easily on Google colab, and even on your own machine.

Here's the awesome examples, just try it on Colab or on your local jupyter notebook
* [GPT 4 Vision - A Simple Demo](GPT-4V-simple-demo.ipynb)
* [GPT Image Generation and Function Calling](GPT-Image-Generation-and-Function-Call.ipynb)
* [GPT 4 Voice Chat on Colab](GPT-4-Voice-Chat.ipynb)
* [PPT Slides Generator by GPT Assistant and code interpreter](GPT-PPT-Slides-Generator.ipynb)
* [GPT 4V vision interpreter by voice from image captured by your camera](GPT-4V-Vision-Interpreter-by-Camera-And-TTS.ipynb)
* [GPT Assistant Tutoring Demo](GPT-Assistant-Tutoring.ipynb)
* [GPT VS GPT, Two GPT Talks with Each Other](GPT-VS-GPT.ipynb)
